Our repo is organized as such that is the best way for android to operate. There are the files for all of the
needed app and gradle files. There are also the files from the other parts of the project. There is also some
folders for the Javadocs and Doxygen.

The best way to get all of the correct documentation is to clone the entire project. You can then open the Javadoc 
folder and open those main overview html file and they will display as a webpage. The way to access the Doxygen 
files is the same but you must navigate through BufflifeV3/app/src/main/java/com/bufflife/bufflife. Once there you 
will find the html, latex, and rtf files for the auto documentation. 

To access the code to run and test the project you must clone the entire project. Open it within android studio. To
see the code you can navigate to BufflifeV3/app/src/main/java/com/bufflife/bufflife for the main classes used. To 
access the test cases navigate to BufflifeV3/app/src/test/java/com/bufflife/bufflife. To run the applicaiton in the 
android studio emulator just press the play button at the top. To run the tests select the BufflifeV3/app/src/test/
java/com/bufflife/bufflife and left click on it and say that you want to run the tests in that file. That should 
run the tests.
